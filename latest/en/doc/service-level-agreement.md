# Validate an SLA with business

A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.
The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract.

A good SLA is described as SMART:
- Specific — defines expectations for service delivery with sufficient detail and specificity;
- Measurable — describes the ways that actual performance will be measured and tracked against promised SLA performance targets (e.g., uptime, response time);
- Achievable — delineates realistic performance goals;
- Relevant — relates directly to both the technology service being delivered and the ways that service is evaluated; and
- Timely — includes timeframes against which the service will be delivered.
